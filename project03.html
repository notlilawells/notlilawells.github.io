            <h1>I've been working with relational databases for some time now, so I figured it was time to try creating a database myself (with an interactive Python application to match!)</h1>
            <h3>When searching for suitable datasets to convert into database form, I stumbled across a dataset by the the City of Chicago. The dataset (originally in <em>CSV</em> format) contained information derived from inspections of restaurants and other food establishments in Chicago from January 1, 2010 to the present. Inspections were performed by staff from the Chicago Department of Public Health Protection Program using a standardized procedure. The results of the inspection are inputted into a dataset file, then reviewed and approved by a State of Illinois Licensed Environmental Health Practitioner (LEHP)</h3>
            <h3>The uncleaned dataset had over 600,000 observations across 20+ variables. So, I downloaded the file in <em>CSV</em> format and cleaned it with Python (i.e., removing duplicates and null values as well as outliers). I then divided the dataset into seven <em>CSV</em> files, and used <em>Microsoft Azure's</em> Import Wizard commands to refine and upload the <em>CSV</em> files to the cloud into a new database (which I <em>very creatively</em> called Food Food-Inspections</h3>
            <h3>Each cleaned <em>CSV</em> file represented a future table in the database. When using <em>Azure's</em> Import Wizard commands, I specified several Foreign and Primary key constraints within each table (forming relationships between them).</h3>
            
            <h2 class='subtitle'>the database at a glance (entity relationship diagrams)</h2>
            <h3>See the entity relationship diagram I created for the <em>Food Inspections</em> database below. You will see that, within the database itself, most tables have a one-to-many relationship with those adjascent to them.</h3>

                <li role="listitem" class="cmd-li">Command 5: Here, you input a store ID and the program outputs information on that store and its inspections. </li>

                <li role="listitem" class="cmd-li">Command 8: Here, you input a Chicago zip code, and the program outputs store types in that zip code (i.e. <em>restaurants, grocery stores, hospitals, daycares</em>) and what percentage of store types in that zip code passed inspection.</li>
                <li role="listitem" class="cmd-li">Command 9: Here, you input a store ID and the program outputs what percent of that stores inspections that store passed, failed, passed with conditions, etc.</li>
